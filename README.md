# Angular-WebAPI-Identity
a sample, fully working application with a single-page application client and a web api backend. This project demonstrates authentication and authorization from angular to a web api using the OAuth2 tokens implementation in ASP.NET Identity.
Tehcnologies used include:
* Angular JS front end client
* ASP.NET Web API 2 backend
* ASP.NET Identity 2 OAuth tokens, includes refresh tokens
* Entity Framework 6 Code First

While this code is fully working, it is meant as a learning journey.  I'm continually improving it as I work through its quirks, issues, etc.

The initial project template used was the [HotTowel SPA template for Angular](https://github.com/johnpapa/HotTowel-Angular), created by [@john_papa] (www.twitter.com/john_papa)

Feel free to fork this project and make it your own.
